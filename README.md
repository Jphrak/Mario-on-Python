# Mario-on-Python
A Python version of Mario using pygame and built my Sophomore year of College.

To run this file, have Python 3.8 installed and run game.py!

All the code is in one file and I took advantage of classes and functions to make this work.

-Left Ctrl is to shoot a fireball that will set the Goombas on fire and eventually they disappear from the screen. <br>
-X is the Goobma editor, enabling allows the user to place Goombas as they walk back and forth due to collision detection on the Tubes. <br>
-C is the Tube editor, enabling allows the user to place Tubes anywhere on the screen. Every tube has collision detection properties. <br>
